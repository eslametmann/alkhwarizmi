        <p>birthplace as <i>Khwarazm</i>, and he is generally thought to have come from this region</p>
        <p>Al-Khw?rizm? accomplished most of his work between 813 and 833. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, Baghdad had become the centre of scientific studies and trade. He worked in <strong>the House of Wisdom</strong> established by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'm?n, where he studied the sciences and mathematics, including the translation of Greek and Sanskrit scientific manuscripts. He was also a historian who is frequently cited by the likes of al-Tabari and Ibn Abi Tahir.</p>
        <h3>contributions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>He is known as the father of algebra. The word 'algebra' comes from the title of one of his most famous books</li>
          <li>The word <strong>'algorithm'</strong> is derived from the Latinization of his name</li>
          <li>His influence on later mathematicians was enormous. <strong>Fibonacci</strong> took up his work, and in this manner, European scholars learned elements of his mathematics that helped kickstart the Enlightenment</li>
          <li>Al Khwarizmi was also a renowned astronomer. Historians credit him with inventing the sine quadrant, an astronomical measurement device</li>
          <li>So great is his fame in mathematics and astronomy, a prominent crater on the moon is named after Al Khwarizmi</li>
